ExactTempo now supports Slack as a delivery channel for your posts.

- **Personal Slack Settings** connect ExactTempo to your Slack account. Slack users will not be able to tell the message came from ExactTempo.
- **Publication Delivery Settings** allow you to set which delivery channels (email or Slack) you would like to use by default. You can also specify your default Slack channel.
- **Post Review** is a new step before publishing a post. The review page allows you to modify which delivery channels you would like to use for your post.
- **Post Status** is a new page that shows the delivery status of your post. This has been removed from the Insights page because Insights are specific to email.
